# Data fetching

**Look at the solution from Karl**

we can decide how the functions being called: can pass them a parameter / or not if we dont care;
- eg: onClick --> ignore the event parameter but passing another parameter

vm takes more time to run the app

effect notes Sept 3rd

console.log:
- 
- no render / change on the component

cant insert some functino change the state
- may be infunute
- call the API / loop again 
- need to use the side effect

- call the dependencies array: will get ride of the repotions

pass everything in funcitons / pass functions around:
- functins allow passing behaviour around; we can use it latre on

useEffect: runs after rendering
eg: - set timeout

#### clean up

#### Stale Closure
- closure

- not taking the updated value
