# Day 2 JavaScript

## JS in browser

Js in NODE is different with JS in browser (although they are all JavaScript)
eg: "process" is bulit-in variable in NODE but not browser JS


#### examples
JS came out to make the brwoser programable: enable interact with some actions like "click / move mouse eg"

document something here  --> a DOM object
eg. get the H1 tag bu queryselecter 
assign it to a const 
GEt the tille by inner text

---

.style can see to all the styles properties

eg: if we get a const with a tag; when we do the click function with Object, it will lead to another page


---

Overall, can chagne the website layout by changing its porperties

## jQuery
a JS library
event handing, animation, Ajax etc

some website have but some not: jsut type jQeury in browser.
  in the site, its a function
  its equal to a "$"
  dont have to loop througn
  
  

Download JS:
  compree version: less size 
  also can use online jaquery --> the site may be down
Its better look at the API than w3schools


`
this allow 
the string have multi
 lines with ``
`

"But this can be only one line"

a function: serialize --> get all the data together

Challenge: 
- Find the Selector
- Delete dom.node in JS

## NEED TO KNOW: 
1. !important
2. Opacity VS display
  1. Usage:
    - Opacity: 0 (disappear) / 1 (appear);
    - display: none / block;
  - Opacity wont move the elements from the screen, oppontsently, the display will. Once it is set to another value, it squuze tge bottom space.
