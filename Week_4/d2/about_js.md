### Day 2 JavaScript

Js in NODE is different with JS in browser (although they are all JavaScript)
eg: "process" is bulit-in variable in NODE but not browser JS

JS came out to make the brwoser programable: enable interact with some actions like "click / move mouse eg"

document something here  --> a DOM object
eg. get the H1 tag bu queryselecter 
assign it to a const 
GEt the tille by inner text

.style can see to all the styles properties

eg: if we get a const with a tag; when we do the click function with Object, it will lead to another page
