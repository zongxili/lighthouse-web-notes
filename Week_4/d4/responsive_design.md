# Responsive Design
Some websites build a completely separate mobile site and host it on its own domain (ex. m.wikipedia.org)

Canbe broowed from the pront design. such as the nyt.

One thing notice, when we design the site, especially for the Mobile design, we should make it both sutiable for Finger Clicked and cursor.

-->> the Finger could be much larger and hard to aim.


### FLexbox 
- the flex container is a BLOCK element
  - display: flex.
  - It never lets things overlap.

### Media Query
- Breakpoint: the number in Pixel we pass in the media Query.
  * Setting the max / min Width: ch, em, rem, pt(points), px: [an useful reading](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp)

### NEED TO KNOW:

the amazon / wiki: different version in the same URLs, the brwoseer tackle this and make decision based on USER AGENT.

1. NEED TO KNOW THE USER AGENT.

2. Adaptive design. VS Responsive Design
